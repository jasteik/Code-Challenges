# Code-Challenges
Coding problems and my code in Python to solve them. 

I will write a coding challenge / question at the top of the page. Then below it I will write my code to solve the challenge. 
I am doing this to show how I can take problems and solve them. Also, what my programming style is like. 

To better see the code and how it works I reccomend copying the code and then inputing into a python ide such as visual studio to run the code.
